                    Absolute and relative URLs are both ways to specify the location of
                    a resource on the internet, typically used in web development and
                    when linking between web pages. The main difference lies in how they
                    specify the location of the resource:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Absolute URLs: An absolute URL provides the complete address of
                    the resource, including the protocol (such as HTTP or HTTPS), domain
                    name (or IP address), and the path to the specific resource.
                    Example: https://www.example.com/images/picture.jpg Absolute URLs
                    are self-contained and can be used to directly locate a resource
                    from anywhere on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Relative URLs: A relative URL specifies the location of a
                    resource relative to the current page or the current domain.
                    Relative URLs don't include the protocol and domain part. Instead,
                    they only specify the path to the resource relative to the current
                    location. They are often used within the same website to link to
                    other pages or resources. Example: If you're on the page
                    https://www.example.com/index.html and want to link to an image in
                    the same directory, you could use a relative URL like
                    images/picture.jpg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, absolute URLs provide the complete address of a
                    resource, including the protocol and domain, while relative URLs
                    specify the location of a resource relative to the current page or
                    domain. Relative URLs are often more flexible and convenient for
                    linking within the same website, while absolute URLs are necessary
                    when linking to external resources or when the exact location of the
                    resource needs to be explicitly specified.

                        Using relative URLs over absolute URLs offers several advantages,
                        particularly in web development: Portability: Relative URLs make
                        your website more portable because they are not tied to a specific
                        domain. This means if you need to move your website to a new
                        domain or subdomain, you don't have to update every link within
                        your site. Flexibility: Relative URLs allow for more flexibility
                        when developing and testing websites locally. You can use the same
                        relative URLs for local development and production environments
                        without needing to change them.

            <h2>How do you create a link to an email address in HTML?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>For a developer to be able to create an Email address in his HTML he must have to use the anchor tag.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Example:</em> <a href=":joeetubi@gmail.com">Send an email</a>

                </h2>

            </div>
            <div>

                The <em>target</em> attribute in an anchor tag (<a>) specifies where to open
                    the linked document when the user clicks on the link. It determines the behavior of the link in
                    terms of how the linked content is displayed. The target attribute can take various values to
                    achieve different behaviors:
                    When you want to the anchor tag url that you provide to stay on the same page as the first
                    opened page, you provide this
                    <a href="joeetubi@gmail.com" target="_self">send an email </a> above anchor tag stays on the
                    page while this open in another window
                    <a href="joeetubi@gmail.com" target="_top"> Send an email</a>

                    <p>
                        To link an external stylesheet to an HTML document, you use the
                        <link> element within the

                        <head> section of your HTML document. Here's how you do it:

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The hreflang attribute in HTML is used to specify the language and optionally the region of the linked
                document. It is primarily used for indicating to search engines which language and regional variations
                of a
                webpage are available so that they can serve the most appropriate version to users based on their
                language
                preferences and location.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <em>Example:</em>
                    <code> <<span>link rel="alternate" hreflang="language_code" href="URL_of_alternate_page"</span>></code>
                </p>

                    When you have several

                    hreflang attribute to specify each language version:

                <p>
                <div> link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://example.com/english-page.html"

            <h2>Explain the structure of an HTML form.</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                An HTML form is used to collect input from users and submit it to a server for processing. It consists
                of
                several components, each with its own purpose. Here's an overview of the structure of an HTML form:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Form Element: The form element is used to create the form container. It contains all the input elements
                and defines how the data will be sent to the server.

                <code>
                        <div> 
                            form action="/submit_form.php" method="post"
                            <!-- Input elements go here -->
                            /form
                            
                        </div>
                        

                    </code>

            <p>action: Specifies the URL where the form data will be submitted.</p>
            <p> method: Specifies the HTTP method used to send the form data (GET or POST). </p>

            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div>
            <h2>
                What are the different types of form inputs available in HTML?

            </h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Form tag is the html element that serves as a container to house input to be collected from the user to
                be store in the server. And different types of input are available for the developer to use e.g Text
                Input: Allows users to enter a single line of text, Password Input: Similar to text input but hides the
                entered characters, Radio Button: Allows users to select one option from a list, Checkbox: Allows users
                to select one or more options from a list.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div>
            <h2>
                Describe the purpose of the action attribute in a form tag.
            </h2>
        </div>

        <div>
            The action attribute in an HTML <form> tag specifies the URL where the form data will be submitted for
                processing when the form is submitted by the user. In other words, it defines the endpoint or
                destination where the browser should send the form data.
                action="/submit_form.php": This attribute specifies the URL "/submit_form.php" as the endpoint where the
                form data will be sent.
